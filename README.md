# UNP_Project_BI_with_Power_BI_Popular_Movies_Dashboard

As part of my internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyse Popular Movies. The dashboard tracks Vital KPIs such as Total movies, Total users, Total Ratings and Total tags & genres, providing valuable insights into Popular tags, Popular Genres over the years, Tag-Relevance and IMBD & TMBD links.

- Track trends over time: Analyze movie releases, ratings, and revenue across years and decades.  
- Compare genres: Explore popularity, ratings, and box office performance side by side.  
- Analyze ratings & reviews: Investigate rating distributions and their impact on revenue.  
- Visualize data: Use charts, graphs, and maps to uncover patterns.  
- Gain insights: Make data-driven decisions for production, distribution, and marketing.  

Ideal for film enthusiasts, industry professionals, and researchers, this dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the movie industry.
